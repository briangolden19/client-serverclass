# I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using different methods, or definitions in Python, that have clear names and are commented to explain what is going on. This helps me or anyone come back and look at the code later and know exactly what is going on. Working in this way makes it easy to update and keep up to date on the current business needs. The Python module can be updated in the future to use different databases and port numbers with simple changes to the code. This could be made more modular with more parameters in the initialization of the module. I make sure that I create programs that can be modified easily and are modular for future use. The major difference with the way I handled this course was that I had to consider queries into a database. Other than that I was able to use the same modular approach I have used for other classes. I believe that computer scientists work to make efficient programs that can accomplish the goals set for them. This means creating programs that meet company standards and project requirements.
